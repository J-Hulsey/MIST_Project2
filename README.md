# DESCRIPTION OF DATASET
This dataset represents Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) that are currently registered through the Washington Department of Licensing. We obtained the dataset from the website provided: (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The varying data types include the make and model of the car, VIN number, and electric vehicle type; these data types are strings. Numeric measurements such as the electric vehicle range and base MSRP are of datatype number(whole), with the date of the model of the car being of datatype date & time. This dataset helps us depict the reality of electric vehicles within the state of Washington within the period of 1997 to the present day and draw conclusions for consumers based upon this dataset.

# QUESTION 1

### QUESTION: 
Is there a correlation between newer PHEV and BEV car models and longer electric car ranges? And if so, how significant is that correlation?

### SIGNIFICANCE: 
The general significance of this question lies with the consumer in the electric vehicle market, especially in areas similar to the state of Washington. The answer to this question provides potential consumers with information regarding the relationship between newer car models and electric car ranges among Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV). Depending on which car model the consumer prefers, this information would help them consider if purchasing a newer car model will generally lead to improved range on their vehicle.

After analyzing the average electric range of cars from this dataset by manufacturing year and type, we can infer that there is a significant increase in the electric range of Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) models created from 2000 to 2010 of over 240 miles on average. Post 2010 there was actually a sharp decline in average electric range temporarily, with a steady recovery to the rate we saw in 2010 models. We can also see that by 2020, the average electric range of new BEVs surpassed that of any year in Washington. Also included and labeled in orange are Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). Although we want to focus on the fully electric cars labeled in blue, it is interesting to note that the average electric range of hybrids also declined for models after 2010 yet did not experience the same recovery in the 2020 model in the state.

After viewing the results of the first diagram, we filtered the data to include only the top 20 makes of cars with model year 2008 or later. This change aided in eliminating outliers and void space on the visual from the years 1996-2007. Our results show a similar trend to the initial graph for each vehicle type. BEVs have a large uptick in their average range starting in 2008 and peaking at 245 average miles in 2010. Then 2011 still showed a steep decline in efficiency, followed by a positive trend until peaking again in 2020 at approximately 278 miles average for Battery Electric Vehicles. The Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles are not nearly as efficient in terms of average range, but, notably, their data mirrors the spike in 2010 with a following drop. Also, as in the first visual, the data shows that PHEVs never received the attention in development to exceed that previous peak as the BEV trend shows. A separate detail on the tail end of the diagram after 2020. PHEVS’ continue their slight up-and-down trend, but there is very little or zero data for BEVs. This is mainly due to a lack of owners buying newer vehicles around this time.


# QUESTION 2

### QUESTION: 
"Which make of car has the highest rate of purchase for each type of electric vehicle in Washington?"

### SIGNIFICANCE: 
This question and the relevant data are significant as they allow one to understand who the market leaders are for both PHEVs and BEVs. By understanding who the market leaders are in the electric car market, consumers can make more informed decisions on what kind of electric vehicle to purchase. In the mind of many consumers, BEVs, and PHEVs, with more market share may be better options than BEVs and PHEVs with less market share as there must be a reason that more of one kind of car is bought over others. 

### PHEV's:

The market disparity for PHEVs or Plug-in Hybrid Electronic Vehicles is fairly balanced. While observing the pie graph, it is easy to understand the level of this balance, as no piece of the pie graph is visually observable as unordinary or larger than the others. On the heat chart, we are able to get a much deeper insight into the specificity of this balance, as "TOYOTA" holds a slim margin of a lead over other brands such as "CHEVROLET", "BMW", and "JEEP".

### BEV's:

The market disparity for BEVs or Battery Electric Vehicle is wildly dissimilar to the disparity of PHEVs, as easily displayed by the pie graph. Upon initial glance, it is easy to see the wide margin that "TESLA" holds over its competitors, as shown by the tannish color piece of pie that takes up > 50%. When we look at the heat chart, we can easily observe the margin of lead that "TESLA" holds over the next most dominant brand ("NISSAN"), but can tell that the margin is nearly 4 times as much.

From these four graphs, we are not only able to develop a deep understanding of the market that exists in the state of Washington for Battery Electric Vehicle and Plug-in Hybrid Electronic Vehicles individually, but we are also able to draw conclusions about the overall size of the market. From the heat charts, we are able to conclude that the market for "TESLA's" BEVs is larger than the entire market for PHEVs. From the pie graphs, we are able to conclude that the market for "TESLA's" BEVs are comparatively larger in the BEV market than "CHEVROLET", "CHRYSLER", "BMW", "FORD", and "JEEP" are combined in the PHEV market.

# MANIPULATIONS
We did not manipulate any raw data, but we did filter out irrelevant data and apply measurable functions to certain columns. In Q1, we filtered data to only include the top 20 makes of EVs with model year 2008 or later. We also applied the average function to "Electric Range" in order to set a standard for comparing the electric range of electric vehicle types year after year. For Q2, we applied the count function to "Electric Vehicle Type" in order to compare the amount of EV types manufactured for each make. All filters/marks applied to the data are solely intended to show the viewer quantifiable information related to the questions. In regards to integrity, our data has no inaccuracies, irrelevancies, or 3rd party imports.
